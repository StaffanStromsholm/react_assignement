This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Mock Blog application built with React.

As a fake DB I used https://my-json-server.typicode.com/, it hosts my fake rest API DB. POSTing to it does not work, but if you clone the project to your local machine, you can use http://localhost:3000/posts as endpoint for GET and POST.

1. Download the repository
2. 
```shell
npm install
npm start
```
